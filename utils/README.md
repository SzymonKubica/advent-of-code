# Utilities

This directory contains libraries for reusable utilities that are applicable for
solutions across different years.

A good example of a utility would be a set of abstractions for manimpulating
points on a 2D grid (e.g. translating a point by another point as a vector, or
getting neighbours of a point on a square grid).

The design of the utility modules should allow for importing the code into the
actual solutions that are present in the year-specific directories.
